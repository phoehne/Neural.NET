 * 
 * (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions 
 * and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

 * of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you 
 * create.
 * 
 * (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions 
 * and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

 * 3. Conditions and Limitations
 * 
 * (A) Reciprocal Grants- For any file you distribute that contains code from the software

 * name, logo, or trademarks.
 * 
 * (C) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are 
 * infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends 
 * automatically.
 *

 * trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.
 * 
 * (E) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only 
 * under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution.

 * local laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
